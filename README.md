# Akai-LPD8-Chataigne-Module

this controls the Akai's LPD8 by MIDI
in the Values Section, you'll find the 8 knobs and the 8 Pads
use the "Set Offset" in the Parameter section to get the right Pad Note Numbers shown in the Values-Section
this depends of your User-Configuration of the LPD8's Pads
Offset=0 means the  Pad-1-Value responds to Note 0
By Default and for Preset-1, the first Pad on the LPD8 has Note NÂ°36; in consequence, set the Offset to 36 to get it shown on Pad-1 in the Module.

Programm-Change response will be added in a later version....
